\section{Scale Effects}
\emph{"According to Himeno \parencite{himeno_prediction_1981} scale effects
of roll damping are mainly associated with skin friction related damping which
however often constitute a negligible part of the total damping. Therefore, damping
derived from model tests are normally transferred directly to full scale using a nondimensional
formulation expressed as the ratio between the actual damping and the
critical damping of the rolling motion."} \parencite{soder_assessment_2019}.

\subsection{Damping was higher in full scale \parencite{soder_assessment_2019}}
Roll decay model test and full scale tests were conducted in \parencite{soder_assessment_2019}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bilge keel 50\% in boundary layer in model test
    \item Questionable model test setup
    \item Different GM in model test and fulls scale
    \item Ship hull fouling in full scale.
\end{itemize}

\emph{"Evaluated roll damping from full scale tests shows good agreement
with model tests for a Panamax Pure Car and Truck Carrier. This indicates a good
potential for the approach as such and also builds confidence in the procedure of
applying roll damping evaluated from model tests on full scale vessels."} \parencite{soder_assessment_2019}.
