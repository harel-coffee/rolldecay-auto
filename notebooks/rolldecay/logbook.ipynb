I developed a python wrapper for SSPA strip calculation tool *ScoresII* here: [pyscores2](https://github.com/martinlarsalbert/pyscores2) and calculated the wave roll damping $B_W$.\n",

Switching the $B_{BK}$ also gave an improved accuracy with maximum accuracy with fixed bilge radius $ \\frac{R}{beam}=0.08$ according to:[scores](04_simplified_ikeda/07.2_si_compare.ipynb#scores). \n",
