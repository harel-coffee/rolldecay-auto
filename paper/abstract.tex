Old Stuff: Ikeda
Resent stuff: ?
		
\subsection{Purpose, Objective}
Most semi-empirical formulas were developed more than 40 years ago. Is the empirical part of these formulas still valid for modern ships? Or do they need to be improved? 

Söder et al. \cite{soder_ikeda_2019} has for instance investigated Ikeda’s method for modern volume carriers. Söder et al. \cite{soder_ikeda_2019} concluded that the speed dependence of the bilge keels damping was underestimated by Ikeda’s method for the investigated ships.  

\subsection{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Collection of roll damping using system identification of many roll decay tests to build a roll damping data base.
    \item Verify existing semi-empirical formulas using the roll damping data base. 
    \item Improve existing semi-empirical formulas using machine learning on the roll damping data base.  
\end{itemize}		
			
			
\subsection{Simulations/Analysis}
 
			
\subsection{Results}
The accuracy of existing semi-empirical formulas to predict roll damping will be estimated based on statistical data from the roll damping data base.

Improvements of existing semi-empirical formulas will be proposed.
