\section{Introduction}

If an undamaged ship capsizes, it will most likely do so by reaching a critical roll angle, for obvious geometrical reasons. Ship stability in roll has therefore a lot of attention when designing ships. When also considering the dynamics of ships, the damping of the roll motion will also be very important, in order to avoid large motions when near the resonance frequency. Verifying that a ship has sufficient roll damping is therefore a critical part of all ship designs.
