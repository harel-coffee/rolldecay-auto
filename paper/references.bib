	abstract = {Severe roll angles can be developed by parametric excitation in relatively moderate weather without any apparent pre-warning for the crew onboard. In this study the prospect of using rudder control to mitigate parametric roll was investigated using multi-degree of freedom simulations. A typical modern Pure Car and Truck Carrier was considered and modelled by coupling a roll model with a planar motion manoeuvring model. The combined model was calibrated using in-service, full-scale trials and model tests. Irregular variations of the metacentric height were applied to simulate recorded, full-scale events of parametric roll that have occurred with the considered design. These simulations with rudder roll control showed promising results and demonstrate that the approach could be very efficient for mitigation of parametric roll. © 2013 JASNAOE.},

	volume = {36},
	doi = {10.1016/j.oceaneng.2009.03.005},
	abstract = {We numerically studied the full (six degrees of freedom) motion of a cargo ship without roll stabilizers in rough (sea state 5) conditions for multiple heading angles ranging from 0° (follower seas) to 180° (head seas). We found that the ship exhibits excessive roll motion in quartering (45° off the stern), beam, and head seas. Therefore, roll damping is critical in these conditions. We then investigated the performance of passive and active anti-roll tank (ART) systems and compared their performance in each of the three sea conditions. Each ART consists of three identical tanks, distributed along the centerline of the ship, each of which consists of two vertical ducts connected at the bottom with a horizontal duct. A pump is located at the middle of the horizontal duct of each tank. The pumps are switched on for active ARTs but switched off for passive ones. The loads (forces and moments) exerted on the ship by the ARTs are added to the hydrodynamic loads (e.g., due to pressure and viscous effects) and the thrust in the governing equations of motion of the ship. Whereas both passive and active ARTs are able to reduce the excessive roll motion, active ARTs outperform the passive ones from three perspectives. First, they are more effective in reducing the roll motion. Second, they require much less working liquid. Third, their performance is insensitive to their natural frequencies and, hence, to their geometric design. In addition, we found that head seas are most responsive to ARTs, which suggests that they are effective in mitigating parametric roll. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	doi = {10.1007/s00773-008-0022-5},
	abstract = {Ship motions in a high sea state can have adverse effects on controllability, cause loss of stability, and ultimately compromise the survivability of the ship. In a broaching event, the ship losses control, naturally turning broadside to the waves, causing a dangerous situation and possibly capsizing. Classical approaches to study broaching rely on costly experimental programs and/or time-domain potential or system-based simulation codes. In this paper the ability of Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) to simulate a broaching event in irregular waves is demonstrated, and the extensive information available is used to analyze the broaching process. The demonstration nature of this paper is stressed, as opposed to a validated study. Unsteady RANS (URANS) provides a model based on first principles to capture phenomena such as coupling between sway, yaw, and roll, roll damping, effects of complex waves on righting arm, rudders partially out of the water, etc. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method uses a single-phase level-set approach to model the free surface, and dynamic overset grids to resolve large-amplitude motions. Before evaluating irregular seas two regular wave cases are demonstrated, one causing broaching and one causing stable surf riding. A sea state 8 is imposed following an irregular Bretschneider spectrum, and an autopilot was implemented to control heading and speed with two different gains for the heading controller. It is concluded that the autopilot causes the ship to be in an adverse dynamic condition at the beginning of the broaching process, and thus is partially responsible for the occurrence of the broaching event. © 2008 JASNAOE.},

	volume = {218},
	doi = {10.1243/1475090041737958},
	abstract = {In this work a combined analytical-numerical approach is proposed to address the problem of the ship roll motion under the combined action of wind and waves. Roll motion is modelled as a one-degree-of-freedom system non-linear in both damping and restoring. The approach is modular, allowing an easy update of the methodology on the basis of new research outcomes. Realistic environmental conditions regarding the effects of both wind and waves are taken into account and can be easily changed. The spatial correlation of wind gusts is taken into account by means of an 'aerodynamic admittance' function, whereas the moment due to waves is obtained from the sea slope spectrum using the concept of effective wave slope, leading to a 'hydrodynamic admittance' function. Both static and dynamic aspects of the problems are taken into account. The proposed analytical procedure, based on statistical linearization technique, allows approximate statistical averages of the roll motion, assumed to be Gaussian, to be obtained without necessarily resorting to time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations. On the basis of the results obtained, an estimation of the capsize probability can be carried out. It seems that the effect of wind gustiness could be considered very small when compared with the effects of waves and mean wind speed when the metacentric height is sufficiently large. Finally, the presented approach moves towards the concept of 'performance-based analysis', recently introduced at the International Maritime Organization as the basis for future developments of intact stability, in a clear and formal way.},

	abstract = {An extension of the LQR/LQG methodology to systems with saturating actuators, referred to as SLQR/SLQG, where S stands for saturating, is obtained. The development is based on the method of stochastic linearization, whereby the saturation is replaced by a gain, calculated as a function of the variance of the signal at its input. Using the stochastically linearized system and the Lagrange multiplier technique, solutions of the SLQR/SLQG problems are derived. These solutions are given by standard Riccati and Lyapunov equations coupled with two transcendental equations, which characterize both the variance of the signal at the saturation input and the Lagrange multiplier associated with the constrained minimization problem. It is shown that, under standard stabilizability and detectability conditions, these equations have a unique solution, which can be found by a simple bisection algorithm. When the level of saturation tends to infinity, these equations reduce to their standard LQR/LQG counterparts. In addition, the paper investigates the properties of closed-loop systems with SLQR/SLQG controllers and saturating actuators. In this regard, it is shown that SLQR/SLQG controllers ensure semi-global stability by appropriate choice of a parameter in the performance criterion.

	abstract = {For a large floating structure in waves, the damping is computed by the linear diffraction/radiation theory. For most degrees of freedom, this radiation damping is adequate for an accurate prediction of the rigid body motions of the structure at the wave frequencies. This is not particularly true for the roll motion of a long floating structure. For ships, barges and similar long offshore structures, the roll damping is highly nonlinear. In these cases the radiation damping is generally quite small compared to the total damping in the system. More over, the dynamic amplification in roll may be large for such structures since the roll natural period generally falls within the frequency range of a typical wave energy spectrum experienced by them. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that a good estimate of the roll damping is made for such structures. The actual prediction of roll damping is a difficult analytical task. The nonlinear components of roll damping are determined from model and full scale experiments. This paper examines the roll damping components and their empirical contributions. These empirical expressions should help the designer of such floating structures.

	volume = {40},
	abstract = {In October 1998 a post-Panamax C11 class containership encountered extreme weather and sustained extensive loss and damage to deck stowed containers. The motions of the vessel during this storm event were investigated through a series of model tests and numerical analyses that confirmed the vessel's parametric rolling response in head seas at the time of the casualty. These studies provide insight into the conditions in which post-Panamax containerships are likely to experience head sea parametric rolling, and the magnitude of motions and accelerations that can occur. The findings from this investigation are presented in this paper, together with discussion of how such extreme motions impact the design and application of container securing systems. Also outlined in the paper are recommendations for additional research needed to better understand the influence of vessel design and operational considerations on the propensity of post-Panamax containerships towards parametric rolling. This investigation and other recent studies demonstrate that parametric roll in extreme head or near head seas an occur when unfavorable tuning is combined with low roll damping (reduced speed) and large stability variations (governed by wavelength, wave height, general hull form, bow flare, and stern shapes). Parametric rolling is an unstable phenomenon, which can quickly generate large roll angles that are coupled with significant pitch motions. The rolling occurs in phase with pitch, and on containerships introduces high loads into the containers and their securing systems. It appears that post-Panamax containerships may be particularly prone to this behavior. This is an important issue considering the large number of these vessels scheduled for delivery in the next few years.},

	doi = {10.1115/1.3101710},
	abstract = {The mechanics of ship capsize under steady and transient conditions is reviewed, focusing on recent applications of global geometrical techniques of nonlinear dynamics. These yield significant new ideas about capsize in waves and its generalization, the escape of a driven oscillator from a potential well. These ideas are robust against gross changes in the forms of the stiffness and damping functions. Fractal basin boundaries in phase and control space yield useful design criteria against transient capsize, which have been applied to real ships. Invariant manifolds are used to explain and predict the sudden loss of safe basin in the space of the starting conditions, and indeterminate resonant jumps to capsize. Further work is concerned with capsize suppression by heave-roll coupling; effects of parametric excitation; and capsize under a propagating wave front. After this historical review, the practical relevance of the results is assessed, and suggestions are made for a standardized transient testing procedure for hulls. A systematic formulation for rolling in beam waves, employing the effective gravitational field perpendicular to the wave surface and the Froude-Krilov assumption, allows the use of the calmwater GZ curve. With general stiffness and damping functions, dimensional analysis offers insights that are often overlooked: for example, the sustainable wave slope is always proportional to the angle of vanishing stability. A degree of quantification is provided by a design formula derived from the displacement magnification of linear resonance. This is validated by Melnikov theory and simulation. It predicts that under worst-case excitation we have: sustainable wave slope = 2ζθv, where θv is the angle of vanishing stability and ζ is a damping ratio appropriate for heavy roll. So in ocean waves of slope 0.5 (≈30°), a vessel with a θv of one radian needs a damping ratio of about 1/4. Implications for the design of hulls reveal counter-intuitive results: it is the distance of the potential barrier, not its height, that prevents escape or capsize. The formula helps to define a universal capsize diagram. New results on symmetry breaking are finally presented. These show that capsize studies of a symmetric unbiased vessel can give seriously unsafe results. The sustainable wave slope is so sensitive to a symmetry-breaking bias (due to wind or cargo imbalance) that a static heel of 2.5° can halve the sustainable slope over a wide range of sea states.

Experimental data are also used to assess a semi-empirical method that today provides input for the prediction of critical rolling events such as parametric rolling and severe rolling motions in general.},

	abstract = {In this paper Ikeda’s method for roll damping prediction is revisited and the applicability of the method to modern volume carriers is considered. For volume carriers the hull lift and bilge keel components are the dominating components and the estimation of these components in the original method are benchmarked and scrutinized. It is concluded that the speed dependence of the bilge keels damping is underestimated by the original method. This is partially explained by that Ikeda seems to have underestimated the lift force of the bilge keels in his analytical expressions. Correcting for this and taking account of the lift force-generated pressure on the hull surface gives overall better agreement with model tests. It is also concluded that the hull lift damping component is significantly overestimated with the original method. Non-viscid CFD is used to propose a new generic expression for estimating the lift coefficients for volume carriers which greatly improve the accuracy in comparison to model test results. With these improvements Ikeda’s method is revitalized and the applicability is extended to unconventional volume carriers.},
